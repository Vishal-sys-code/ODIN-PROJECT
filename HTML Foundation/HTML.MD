HTML stands for ```Hyper Text Markup Language```.

A basic HTML document:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is a first level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into red color</h1>
  <h2>This is a second level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into blue color</h2>
  <h3>This is a third level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into green color</h3>
  <p>This is a <em>paragragh</em> As you can see, I placed an empahisis on the word "paragraph". Now, I will change also
    the background color of the word "paragraph" to black, and its text color  to green, all with just CSS.</p>
  <p>The main essence of this tutorial is to:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Show you how to format a web document with HTML</li>
       <li>Show you how to design a web page with CSS</li>
       <li>Show you how to program a web document with JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Next, I am going to add the following two numbers and display the result, all with JavaScript<p/>
    <p>First number:<span id= "firstNum">2</span> <br></p>
    <p>Second number: <span id= "secondNum">7</span> </p>
    <p>Therefore, the sum of the two of those numbers is: <span id= "answer">(placeholder for the answer)</span></p>
    <input type="button" id="sumButton" value="Click to add!">
</body>
</html>
```

This is how you can format and structure a document with just HTML. As you can see, this markup contains some web elements such as:

- Level 1 heading h1
- Level 2 heading h2
- Level 3 heading h3
- A paragraph  p
- An unordered list with bullet points  ul li
- A button input input
- And the whole body of the page body


**Q.) What is the purpose of doctype declaration?**

```
Every HTML page starts with a doctype declaration. The doctypeâ€™s purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is simply <!DOCTYPE html> .
```
